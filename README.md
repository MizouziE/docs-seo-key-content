# SEO Keyword Content Analysis

This application analyses data gathered from your site and your competitor's sites and gives you a comparitive report to highlight where you are missing out on providing content that could help you to rank higher in search engine results and therefore convert more customers.

## Structure

The structure of the data analysed and report given is categorised by the following tree:
1. Brand
2. Region
3. Project/Product
4. Main Site
5. Competitor Site(s)

### Admin Users

An administrative user has all the abilities of a client user, the only difference being that they can view ALL entities that are usualy restricted to a single user. Additionally to this an admin user has the permissions to create any of the categorisation entities and add/edit the associated data.

### Client Users

The client user has permissions to view only their allocated Brand, Projects and Sites. The Sites will already have the region set upon creation and so Region only reflects a filtering method for the client user.
